# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary

My project will entail generating 30 images with a LLM of my choosing to curate a flipbook. The images will combine together and when rapidly clicked through (or flipped through the physical copy) the images will come to life to tell a story. I aim to create an initial image, then feed the image back into the LLM using a chain prompting method to ensure each image is cohesive to one another and can accurately be flipped through. The final product will include both a slideshow to click through virtually, and a physical copy to be flipped through.

## Peer works

1. project2-childrensbook
This project will assist me in providing functions to link an LLM to my prototype, generate the images, save the images to an external file, and create a structure for the flipbook including a title page.

2. prompt7-visual-narrative
This project entails generating images that are cohesive with one another and can be combined to tell a full and complete narrative, which are ideals I aim to include within my final project flipbook.

3. https://thegradient.pub/an-introduction-to-ai-story-generation/ 
This reading goes into detail on how AI can assist in story generation. I will utilize key concepts of this reading, including definitions of narrative, story, and plot, as well as story planners and neutral story generation to better understand the goals I'm aiming to accomplish through my project, and how I can most efficiently implement my code to match those goals.

4. https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/prompt_chaining
This reading defines prompt chaining and explains the various techniques applicable in the process and how to efficiently achieve project goals through these methods. I will utilize prompt chaining within my project to ensure consistency and cohearency within my generated images to most efficiently allow the images to be joined together in a true, flipbook fashion.

## Challenges

1. Choosing the narrative I desire my flipbook to follow, as well as any characters, actions, and settings that I aim to portray.
2. Choosing a LLM that most efficiently produces the flipbook result I aim to produce.
3. Ensuring consistency within the images to ensure they can be joined together in flipbook fashion.
4. Time constraints, especially while focused heavily on implementing my senior composition project as well as finals for other classes.
5. Having to constantly test the images against one another by saving the images to a slideshow to see if the flipbook is being generated correctly.
