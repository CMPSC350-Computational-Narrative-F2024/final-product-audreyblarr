# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

Computational Flipbook

## Description

Regretably, I haven't made much progress in my final product work thus far considering I've been working on other finals, especially my senior composition. I have my general concept solidified of creating a flipbook and I've determined to have two products of my final: A physical flipbook copy, and an online slideshow flipbook version. My next step, arguably the most difficult task in this product, will be selecting an LLM that can most efficiently create my flipbook without the implementation being difficult or even costly. The rest of the project development will be straightforward, where I simply implement the LLM usage to cater to my specific needs and desires for output, then configure a way for each image to be saved so they can be flipped through online, as well as printed.

## Peer Feedback

1. Which prompts or projects that we've completed contain the skill set or implementation you will find most helpful with this project?
2. What will the final product look like in its final form?
3. What LLM does your final product feature? Why are you using this LLM in specific?

### Unstructured peer feedback

TODO: Dedicate this space to a summative comment from a peer. This may require you to share
this repository (briefly) with this person for them to replace this paragraph with the comment.

## Persisting challenges

1. Procrastination!!!
2. Choosing an LLM that is both free of cost and provides quality output
